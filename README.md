## Commands

| Command                          | Description                                                                                         |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `commitwizard`                   | Runs the interactive prompt for writing a commit. It will guide you through selecting a commit category and writing a message. |
| `commitwizard -v` or `--version` | Displays the current version of CommitWizard CLI.                                                   |
| `commitwizard --config`          | Generates a default `.commitwizardrc` configuration file in the current directory. This file can be used to customize the available commit categories. | `commitwizard --log`          | Displays a list of the last 10 commits. | `commitwizard --undo`          | Undo the last commit but keep the changes staged. | `commitwizard --amend`          | Amend the previous commit, either by editing the message or adding new changes |


## Default Commit Categories

CommitWizard provides the following categories for your commit messages:

* **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools
* **ci**: Continuous Integration and deployment
* **docs**: Documentation only changes
* **feat**: A new feature
* **fix**: A bug fix
* **perf**: Performance updates and optimization
* **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* **remove**: Removing files or unnecessary code
* **revert**: Undo changes that have been committed to the repository
* **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
* **test**: Adding tests or correcting existing tests
* **update**: Small updates that do not change functionality

## Example

Stage your changes:

`git add -A`

Run CommitWizard:

`commitwizard`

Select a category and write your commit message:

? Select the type of change that you're committing:

* [feat]: A new feature
* [fix]: A bug fix
* [docs]: Documentation only changes

Write your commit message: `Add feature to handle user login`

The resulting commit message will be:

`[feat]: Add feature to handle user login`

## Customization

CommitWizard allows you to define your own commit categories by creating a `.commitwizardrc` file in the root of your project. 
Running the `commitwizard --config` command will generate the `.commitwizardrc` file for you, including default categories that can be changed.
The file should be written in JSON format, like so:

{
  "categories": [
    { "label": "chore", "description": "Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools" },
    { "label": "feat", "description": "A new feature" }
    // Add more categories as needed
  ]
}
